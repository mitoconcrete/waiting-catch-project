:heavy_check_mark: Aims to use technology with clear reasons and evidence.    
:heavy_check_mark: We aimed for meaningful design by understanding object-oriented concepts and incorporating them into the code.    
:heavy_check_mark: Write unit tests that fail rather than succeed.    
:heavy_check_mark: We tried to increase the efficiency of development by automating repetitive tasks.

## :rocket: Rules

### Git-flow

**According to the Git-flow branch strategy**, we are working by dividing branches by feature.
All branches are merged after completing reviews through pull requests.

<br>

![Github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83831110/220528904-f3387e71-30cc-437e-8e9c-5ce8576112ea.svg)

<br>

:white_check_mark: master :  Indicates a branch that can be released into production.     
:white_check_mark: develop : The branch on which the next release is being developed. We are merging branches that have been reviewed in feature.    
:white_check_mark: feature : A branch that develops features and also includes hotfix bug fixes.

### PR

- Branches are created based on develop, created by domain, and requested for PR. feature/domain name (in English)<br>
- Using [Github Project](https://github.com/users/mitoconcrete/projects/6/views/1) : New: new function, Ready: function to be created, In
  progress: function in progress, <br> In review: function under review, Done: divided into completed functions and division of labor.
- Commits are grouped into C/R/U/D functional units and made in the format of [commit classification] # issue number commit message. ex:[feat] #1 Add login function.
- All PRs must receive a code review from a designated reviewer.
- You can do a 'Merge pull request' only after receiving 'Approve' from all reviewers.
- All PRs must pass through CI/CD of Github Action and become `Merge pull request`.
 
### Review
 
- Maintain consistency by following the set commit convention and coding convention.
- Codes that are not agreed upon are filtered through reviews.
- Merge is only possible with the approval of all team members.
- In the morning (10:00 - 13:00), all members of the team review the PR.
- Reviews are prioritized, starting with those that may affect other tasks.
- Reviews are conducted according to the priority determined at the morning meeting, and merges are conducted at once after the review.
 
### Commit Message Convention
- [feat]: Add new features
- [fix] : bug fix
- [docs] : Fix documentation
- [build] : Modify build-related files
- [style] : Code formatting, if there is no change in the code itself
- [refactor] : code refactoring
- [test] : Add test code
- [merge] : merge
- [design] : User UI design changes such as CSS
- [comment] : Add and change necessary comments
- [rename]: When modifying the file, variable, method, or folder name
- [remove]: In case of deleting unused files or folders

</div>

### Coding Convention
[Naver Hackday Java Coding Convention](https://naver.github.io/hackday-conventions-java)
<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<div markdown="1">  
 
- Use `//` if comments can be organized on one line, and `/**/` if lines need to be skipped through the enter key.
- Service uses interface.
- The value received as a service parameter must be a DTO, and the value that will not change even if beaten to death is used by bringing the controller DTO as it is.
- DTOs are created and passed regardless of the number of parameters.
- DTO is created and used only when there are two or more parameters.
- However, InternalService does not use DTO.
- Use the combination of `verb + noun` for the method name.
- DTO naming is method naming + layer name (Service, Controller) + Response/Request. (DTO excluded)
  - ex) `XxxControllerRequest, XxxServiceResponse, XxxServiceRequest`
- Excluding layer names that do not change when you think about it.
  - ex) `XxxRequest, XxxResponse`
- Define and use a method that returns an entity to be used inside the service layer as _ within the service.
  - ex) _getUser, _getReservation ‚Üí Return Entity
  - ex) getUser, getReservation ‚Üí Return Dto
- When one parameter is declared: get, create, update, delete + by + parameter name
- When two or more parameters are declared: get, create, update, delete + Use abbreviated parameters in one word.
- Multiple variable names: ~s(o), ~List(x)
